[{"question_number":"Question 1","background":"Mayor: There has been a long debate in city council about how to accommodate projected increases in automobile traffic. Today, our choice is clear: either we adopt my plan to build a new expressway, or we do nothing.

The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions.
